    <h2>The 10 Most Popular Programming Languages to Learn in 2022</h2>
    <p>
        There's no question that software programming is a hot career right now. The <span style="color: red;">U.S. Bureau 
        of Labor Statistics</span> projects 21 percent growth for programming jobs from 2018 to 2028, 
        which is more than four times the average for all occupations. What's more, the median 
        annual pay for a software programmer is about $106,000, which nearly three times the 
        median pay for all U.S. workers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Not all programming jobs are the same, however. Different roles, companies, and types of 
        software require knowing and understanding different programming languages—and it's 
        often beneficial to know multiple languages. Trying to break into the field of software 
        programming can be a daunting experience, especially for professionals with no prior 
        programming experience.<br>
        The <span style="color: blue;"><u>Master of Science in Computer Science Align program</u></span> at Northeastern University is 
        specifically designed for students who want to transition into computer science from another 
        field of study.<br>
        <span style="display: block; text-align: center;"><em>“Our aim is to transport students from a variety of different backgrounds and have them 
        come out as software engineers,”</em> says Ian Gorton, PhD and director of the graduate 
        computer science programs at Northeastern University—Seattle. <em>“We focus on math, 
        programming, and a variety of computer science and engineering concepts.”</em></span>
        <span style="display: block; text-align: right;">Whether you're new to programming or looking to brush up on your skills, it helps to know 
        which languages are in high demand. Here are 10 of the most popular programming 
        languages of 2020 based on the number of job postings listed on job search site Indeed, the 
        average annual salary for those jobs, and factors such as ease of use and potential for 
        growth.</span>
